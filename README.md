### 🛡️ Incident Response Fundamentals

**Room:** [Incident Response Fundamentals — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/incidentresponsefundamentals)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** 09 June 2025* 

### 🎯 Objective
Learn what an incident is, how to classify and respond to it, and gain hands-on experience in handling a phishing attack through a complete incident response process based on SANS and NIST frameworks.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- **Incident** — A confirmed harmful activity, often identified after analysing alerts from security systems.  
- **False Positive** — An alert that seems harmful but isn’t.  
- **True Positive (Incident)** — An alert that is genuinely malicious and requires response.  
- **Incident Severity** — Incidents are prioritised as low, medium, high, or critical based on impact.  
- **Types of Incidents** — Includes malware, data breaches, leaks, insider threats, and DoS attacks.  
- **Incident Response Frameworks**:  
  - **SANS** (PICERL): Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned  
  - **NIST**: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident Activity  
- **Playbooks** — Step-by-step guides for specific types of incidents, like phishing or malware infections.  
- **Runbooks** — More detailed step-by-step technical procedures, often used by automation tools.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SIEM** — Correlates logs to identify security incidents.  
- **Antivirus (AV)** — Detects known malware.  
- **EDR** — Offers endpoint protection, visibility, and automated response features.  
- **TryHackMe Lab** — Provided a realistic environment for investigating a phishing campaign from detection to containment.

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Understanding the subtle difference between an alert and an incident took a little time at first.
- The lab taught me to track multiple stages of a phishing incident and examine execution vs download activity.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to move from detection to response using structured frameworks (SANS/NIST).  
- The importance of containment and eradication to stop lateral movement or repeated infections.  
- Learned how playbooks simplify and speed up incident handling.  
- Practised real-world analysis: identifying infected hosts, isolating systems, and confirming actions with a timeline.

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> Incident response is a key job for SOC teams and cyber defenders. Whether responding to phishing, malware, or insider threats, having a structured framework, tools like SIEM and EDR, and a good playbook can make the difference between a minor issue and a full-blown breach.

### 💭 Reflections:
- I really enjoyed the hands-on lab — it helped solidify the theory.  
- SANS' “PICERL” makes it easier to memorise the phases, and the emphasis on **Lessons Learned** stood out.
